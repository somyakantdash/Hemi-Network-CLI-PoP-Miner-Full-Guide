### 1Ô∏è‚É£. Binaries

[Download a pre-built binary](https://github.com/hemilabs/heminetwork/releases) or [build from source using the README](https://github.com/hemilabs/heminetwork?tab=readme-ov-file#-building-from-source). Choose the release you want to use (_if unsure, choose the latest_), and click on `Assets` dropdown:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/pop-miner-binaries-v0.2.8 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Note: the version numbers may be different.</p></figcaption></figure>

The package you will need to download depends on your OS and architecture:

* **Windows (Intel/AMD CPU):** heminetwork\_v0.2.8\_windows\_amd64.zip
* **Mac (Intel CPU):** heminetwork\_v0.2.8\_darwin\_amd64.tar.gz
* **Mac (Apple Silicon "M" CPU):** heminetwork\_v0.2.8\_darwin\_arm64.tar.gz
* **Linux (Intel/AMD CPU):** heminetwork\_v0.2.8\_linux\_amd64.tar.gz
* **Linux (ARM CPU):** heminetwork\_v0.2.8\_linux\_arm64.tar.gz

***

### 2Ô∏è‚É£. Extract the files

After downloading the necessary files, you must extract them from their compressed format before you can use or access the software. On most operating systems, you can right-click on the downloaded archive and choose "Extract" or similar.&#x20;

**Linux/macOS tip**:&#x20;

You can also use the command `tar xvf heminetwork_v0.2.8_linux_amd64.tar.gz`\
\
Run the  `uname -a` command in the Terminal to view all system information, ensuring compatibility with the correct asset on GitHub. \
\
Depending on the output:\
"**x86\_64**" => Choose the "**amd64**" package corresponding to your OS\
"**arm64**" => Choose the "**arm64**" package corresponding to your OS

***

### 3Ô∏è‚É£. Open your CLI and navigate to the extracted folder

Launch your CLI:

**For Windows:**

* Press `‚äû Win` + `R` together to open the "Run Program Or File" Window
* Type "cmd" and press `Enter`


**For macOS:**

* Press `‚åò` + `Space` together to open Spotlight Search
* Type "terminal" and press Enter

\
**For Linux:**

* Depends on OS. On Ubuntu (Gnome): `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T`
* For most other distros, you can press `Super` (Windows Key) and search for Terminal.&#x20;


Navigate to the folder you extracted by typing `cd` (**don't press `Enter` ye**t) and then drag the path of the extracted folder into your CLI, or type the path in manually and then press `Enter`.

* For example on Windows if you downloaded the package to your Downloads folder and extracted it through the GUI, you might run a command like:\
  \
  `cd '/home/user/Downloads/heminetwork_v0.4.3_windows_amd64'`

***

### 4Ô∏è‚É£. Confirm folder contents

List the files:

**For Windows:**

* `dir`  (and press `Enter`)

**For macOS:**

* `ls`  (and press `Enter`)

Your output should be:

*   **Linux & macOS**

    ```none
    bfgd    bssd    extool    hemictl    keygen    popmd    tbcd
    ```
*   **For Windows**

    ```
    bfgd.exe    bssd.exe    extool.exe     hemictl.exe     keygen.exe     popmd.exe     tbcd.exe
    ```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£üÖ±Ô∏è. Open the JSON

If you chose to generate a new private key in Step 6a, open your JSON to view your file contents.&#x20;

**On Windows:** See the above instructions for how to open the file in Notepad.

**On Linux/macOS:** Run the following command to print the contents of your key file to the Terminal:\
\
`cat ~/popm-address.json`

You should see a result like:

```
{
  "ethereum_address": "0x12345FabcD298299b8250e16eEb7D6a7B81DfEdC",
  "network": "testnet",
  "private_key": "123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcdef1234",
  "public_key": "04123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcdef12345678abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789abcdef1234",
  "pubkey_hash": "m12345678P2xVWwVCWxq7tHJLGcJz2h6XYZ"
}
```

***

### 7Ô∏è‚É£. Fund your address

Find your wallet address:&#x20;

* **New Address:** If you generated a new public key in Step 6a, check the JSON file from Step 6b for your `pubkey_hash`.&#x20;
* **Existing BTC Address:** If you are importing a private key from an existing BTC address, change your wallet type to P2PKH (Legacy) and locate the public key.
* **Existing EVM Address:** If you are importing a private key from an existing EVM address, [import your private key into UniSat](btc-wallet-setup/) and select P2PKH (Legacy) as your wallet type.

Fund your wallet:&#x20;

* Claim tBTC in the [Hemi Discord faucet](https://discord.gg/hemixyz) to send at least`0.002 tBTC` to your `pubkey_hash` address.
* You can also get tBTC from faucets [like this one](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/). However, these faucets often don't provide enough tBTC to do much PoP mining.&#x20;

***

### 8Ô∏è‚É£. Run the Miner

In your console, execute the following commands while:

1. replacing `private_key` with either the value from your JSON file in Step 5 **OR** your preexisting EVM/BTC private key,
2. replacing `fee_per_vB_integer` with the fee in sat/vB you want to pay.&#x20;

Read the [**"Bitcoin fee/vB"**](setup-part-1.md#bitcoin-fee-vb) section below if you need help determining what value to set here.&#x20;

**Linux & macOS**

```
export POPM_BTC_PRIVKEY=private_key
export POPM_STATIC_FEE=fee_per_vB_integer
export POPM_BFG_URL=wss://testnet.rpc.hemi.network/v1/ws/public
./popmd
```

**Windows**

```
set POPM_BTC_PRIVKEY=private_key
set POPM_STATIC_FEE=fee_per_vB_integer
set POPM_BFG_URL=wss://testnet.rpc.hemi.network/v1/ws/public

### üîü. üéâ Congrats! You are now a Hemi PoP Miner!

Let us know how this process was for you via [Discord](https://discord.gg/hemixyz). We are constantly looking for ways to improve our documentation.

***

#### **Bitcoin fee/vB**

The Bitcoin transaction (normally represented in satsoshis per virtual byte or sats/vB) is a fee paid to the Bitcoin miners to include a transaction in a Bitcoin block. It varies with network congestion, typically rising during periods of high transaction volume and decreasing when there is less activity.&#x20;

* The PoP Miner consumes tBTC to pay the Bitcoin miners to include PoP transactions in Bitcoin blocks.
* In order to ensure PoP transactions from your PoP miner are included in Bitcoin blocks, ensure the configured fee is set to an appropriate value. The PoP miner can be configured to use a certain fee in sats/vB by changing the `POPM_STATIC_FEE` environment variable when running the PoP miner. In a future version, the PoP miner will automatically calculate the current network fee to guarantee PoP transactions are included in Bitcoin blocks.
* The lower you set the fee, the less tBTC you will pay per PoP transaction. But if your fees are too low, Bitcoin miners may not include your transaction quickly enough for you to successfully PoP mine.

**Beginner and intermediate users:**&#x20;

* We recommend setting the `POPM_STATIC_FEE` environment variable to `50` (50 sats/vB) to ensure PoP transactions are included in Bitcoin blocks.

**Advanced users:**&#x20;

1. Check Current Fee Levels: Visit [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/testnet) to see the current fee levels. Look at the "sat/vB" numbers for the different transaction fee priorities. It is recommended to set the value to the "High Priority" value or slightly higher.
2. Set the Static Fee: Re-run the command to set the `POPM_STATIC_FEE` environment variable from above (`export` on Linux/macOS, `set` on Windows) each time you want to change the fee, and restart the PoP Miner afterwards.
